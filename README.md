# Course Management API

## Overview

The Course Management API is a backend service designed to manage various aspects of a course management system. Built using NestJS, this API provides functionalities for user management, grade tracking, payment processing, and more. It is structured to support role-based access control and integrates with various services for authentication, notifications, and analytics.

## Features

- **User Management**: Create, update, and manage user roles and permissions.
- **Grade Management**: Track and manage student grades with role-based access control.
- **Payment Processing**: Handle payment operations with secure transaction management.
- **Authentication**: Implement email-based magic link authentication for secure access.
- **Reporting and Analytics**: Generate reports and provide analytics dashboards.
- **Notifications**: Send email notifications for important events.
- **API Documentation**: Comprehensive API documentation using Swagger.
- **Testing and Quality Assurance**: Unit, integration, and performance testing to ensure reliability.
- **Security Enhancements**: Input validation, rate limiting, and security headers.
- **Deployment and DevOps**: Containerization with Docker, CI/CD pipeline setup, and cloud deployment.
